# 🧩 Multi-Method Sensitivity Analysis

This repository provides a unified workflow to evaluate parameter sensitivity of CO₂ storage models (or any simulation outputs)
using multiple complementary methods:

- t-test (statistical significance)

- Random Forest (nonlinear importance)

- Lasso regression (sparse feature paths & extinction)

- Correlation analysis (linear relationships)
